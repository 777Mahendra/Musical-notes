Musical notes can be modeled as sinusoids where the iᵗʰ note is given by:

      mᵢ(t) = sin(2πfᵢt)

An *octave* has twelve notes ranging from f₁ to 2f₁ which are spaced equally on a *logarithmic* scale, i.e.,
log(f₁), log(f₂), …, log(f₁₂) form an arithmetic progression.

For the octave range 440 Hz to 880 Hz generate the 12 notes, i.e., in addition to the 440 Hz and 880 Hz tones you should generate ten more notes.

Each note should be of two seconds duration.
